    <p class="ex1">
Given the increasing size of the space industry and the renewed global interest in exploring deep space. New technologies are required to make space flight cheaper, safer and more efficient. Due to its implementation on new rockets, this paper aims to investigate whether electromechanical actuators for use in rocket thrust vectoring control are better than well-established hydraulic actuators and to assess potential obstacles to their implementation in rocketry. Utilising previous findings, the results have been promising: Electromechanical actuators now have few barriers compared to previous decades due to new technologies such as battery technology and computer control. Their advantages over traditional hydraulic actuators have become clear with improvements in reduced mass, volume and maintenance whilst increasing the overall reliability. As a result, it can be concluded that electromechanical actuators are best for thrust vectoring on rockets of the future.

    <h3 id="Introduction" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif"><b>Introduction</b></h3>
    <p class="ex1">
As rockets travel beyond the lower atmosphere, the air gets thinner, and fins on the side of the rocket become less effective as less air flows over them to produce lift <a href="#Dunbar">(Dunbar, 2012)</a>. A method of control is still required. Thrust vectoring, also known as gimbaled thrust, is a means of this. The direction of the rocket's thrust can be redirected to change the rocket's attitude (Figure 1). Thrust vectoring control (TVC) has been used in rockets for a while. The Saturn V launch vehicle utilised TVC on its four outer engines in its first stage <a href="#Saturn V fueldraulic">(Power & Motion, 2017)</a>. The engines are moved with actuators that must withstand tens of thousands of newtons and continue to work. Where they fail, the consequences are catastrophic. Earlier this year, SpaceX’s Starship's first flight failed due to the failure of the TVC contributing to the rocket tumbling out of control <a href="#Ward">(Ward,</a> 2023; <a href="Bergin">Bergin, 2023)</a>. SpaceX later made the switch from hydraulic actuators to electromechanical actuators for the future second flight of Starship <a href="#Romera">(Romera, 2023)</a>.

<h5 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif"><b>Hydraulic Acutators</b></h4>

<p class="ex1">Hydraulic actuators are a more mature technology than electromechanical actuators (EMA) and have been extensively used in spaceflight. They were used on the Space Shuttle’s Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) (Figure 2). Therefore, these systems are better understood. Hydraulic actuators commonly use a pressurised propellant line to achieve high pressures and hydraulic power, this is only present in liquid-fuelled engines <a href="#Bates and Young">(Bates & Young, 2012)</a>. Solid fuelled and other methods of rocket propulsion aren’t compatible, hydraulic power can be “generated by hydraulic turbopumps and dedicated propellant systems” <a href="#Bates and Young">(Bates & Young, 2012)</a>.</p>

<p class="ex1">However, turbopumps typically rely on the decomposition of toxic propellants for example, hydrazine, a carcinogen <a href="#Bates and Young">(Bates & Young, 2012;</a> <a href="#US EPA">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1992)</a>. Resultingly, hydraulic TVC systems have an environmental risk which raises costs due to safety, storage and handling measures. Theoretically, “one could simply replace the heritage turbo pump with a fixed speed electric motor driven variable displacement pump while leaving the rest of the heritage system unchanged.” <a href="#Bates and Young">(Bates & Young, 2012)</a>. However, the system mass and volume would increase <a href="#Bates and Young">(Bates & Young, 2012)</a>, making the rocket harder to get into orbit.</p>

<p class="ex1">Furthermore, maintenance of hydraulic systems is expensive and time-intensive with limited parts availability. Take the Space Shuttle Orbiter, the hydraulic lines had to be examined for faults and leaks which is labour intensive. “Qualification alone necessitates extensive hours, or about 10 per cent of the total inspection time.” <a href="#Cowan and Weir">(Cowan & Weir, 1994)</a>. It is estimated that if the Space Shuttle used EMA, the turn-around time would be reduced by 10 days <a href="Cowan and Weir">(Cowan & Weir, 1994)</a>.</p>

<h5 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif"><b>Electromechanical Actuators</b></h5>

<p class="ex1">In comparison, EMA are a contemporary technology used in TVC systems on rocket engines. However, they were used on the Apollo Service Propulsion System and Shuttle Orbital Manoeuvring System <a href="#Bates and Young">(Bates & Young, 2012)</a>. The use of these systems on rockets has been established and by 1994 had been in service for more than 30 years <a href="#Cowan and Weir">(Cowan & Weir, 1994)</a>.</p>

<p class="ex1">EMA result in a shorter turnaround time for reusable craft (Cowan & Weir, 1994), a relevant feature due to new spacecraft e.g., Starship having a core design principle of reusability. These systems have increased reliability <a href="#Schinstock 1998">(Schinstock et al., 1998)</a> and are simpler and easier to maintain than hydraulic systems <a href="#Cowan and Weir">(Cowan & Weir, 1994;</a> <a href="#Bates and Young">Bates & Young, 2012)</a>.</p>

<p class="ex1">The hazard from hydraulics is eliminated with EMA as there isn’t any fluid to leak (Bates & Young, 2012), making the system cleaner and safer (Cowan & Weir, 1994).</p>

<p class="ex1">Regarding weight and volume, EMA outperforms hydraulic systems due to their smaller components, they “would consist of only a pair of actuators along with a set of controller boxes and a bank of battery modules” (Bates & Young, 2012), (Figure 3), leading to more energy-efficient vehicles (Cowan & Weir, 1994) due to the reduced mass of the rocket.</p>

<p class="ex1">An additional advantage of EMA is increased precision. Test results comparing the systems using the Space Shuttle STS-44 SRB flight profile to command the actuator show that the position error between what the command dictates and the actual position is lower and varies less (Figure 4) (Cowan & Weir, 1994). Notably, the EMA actuators did not experience the forces from flight during testing, potentially leading to misleading results (Cowan & Weir, 1994).</p>

<p class="ex1">EMA systems still have flaws that need to be resolved before deployment. The main two are susceptibility to corona discharge at high altitudes (Bates & Young, 2012) and forces on the TVC system causing resonance (Schinstock et al., 2001).</p>

<p class="ex1">Corona discharge results from “dielectric constant of the air changes with altitude, making it easier at higher altitudes for high voltages to break down the dielectric barrier of the air” (Bates & Young, 2012). The chance of this vanishes in space due to no atmosphere. Corona discharges can lead to a voltage drop and energy release, these are issues because the drop “causes interference with neighboring communication circuits due to electromagnetic transients and electrostatic induction effects.” and the energy loss is “undesirable and uneconomical.” (Rehman, 2021). To prevent corona discharges, the voltage of the system “cannot exceed 270-300 V (DC) during assent” (Nelms, 1993).</p>

<p class="ex1">Forces on the TVC system during engine startup and shutdown can lead to resonance in the system which can lead to failure. This can be resolved by adding a dynamic force feedback (DFF) controller to the system to reduce the effects of transient forces (Schinstock et al., 2001).</p>

<h5 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif"><b>Conclusion</b></h5>

<p class="ex1">In conclusion, EMA TVC overwhelmingly have an advantage over hydraulic TVC because they have a lower mass and volume with higher precision and environmental sustainability. If issues with sustaining power without a corona discharge are resolved, EMA is the future system for TVC.</p>
