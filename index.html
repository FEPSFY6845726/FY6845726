    <p class="ex1">
    Given the increasing size of the space industry and the renewed global interest in exploring deep space. New technologies are required to make space flight cheaper, safer and more efficient. Due to its implementation on new rockets, this paper aims to investigate whether electromechanical actuators for use in rocket thrust vectoring control are better than well-established hydraulic actuators and to assess potential obstacles to their implementation in rocketry. Utilising previous findings, the results have been promising: Electromechanical actuators now have few barriers compared to previous decades due to new technologies such as battery technology and computer control. Their advantages over traditional hydraulic actuators have become clear with improvements in reduced mass, volume and maintenance whilst increasing the overall reliability. As a result, it can be concluded that electromechanical actuators are best for thrust vectoring on rockets of the future.

    As rockets travel beyond the lower atmosphere, the air gets thinner, and fins on the side of the rocket become less effective as less air flows over them to produce lift (Dunbar, 2012). A method of control is still required. Thrust vectoring, also known as gimbaled thrust, is a means of this. The direction of the rocket's thrust can be redirected to change the rocket's attitude (Figure 1). Thrust vectoring control (TVC) has been used in rockets for a while. The Saturn V launch vehicle utilised TVC on its four outer engines in its first stage (Power & Motion, 2017). The engines are moved with actuators that must withstand tens of thousands of newtons and continue to work. Where they fail, the consequences are catastrophic. Earlier this year, SpaceXâ€™s Starship's first flight failed due to the failure of the TVC contributing to the rocket tumbling out of control (Ward, 2023; Bergin, 2023). SpaceX later made the switch from hydraulic actuators to electromechanical actuators for the future second flight of Starship (Romera, 2023).
